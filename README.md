# Web Access Advisor

A React-based accessibility testing tool that records user interactions, replays them with snapshot capture, and provides AI-powered accessibility analysis using Google Gemini.

## üéØ Features

- **Record-First Approach**: Capture user interactions without slowing down the experience
- **Smart DOM Change Detection**: Only snapshots when meaningful changes occur  
- **Component-Focused Analysis**: AI analysis targeting 16+ interactive component types
- **Before/After State Comparison**: Analyzes how components behave during interactions
- **Axe-Core Integration**: Real accessibility testing with structured results
- **Actionable Reports**: Provides actual HTML fixes, not just descriptions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd web-access-advisor

# Install dependencies (triggers automatic browser download)
npm install
```

> **Note**: The `postinstall` script automatically downloads Playwright browsers (~100MB) after `npm install` completes. This ensures consistent testing across all environments and CI/CD pipelines.

### Required Build Steps

Before starting the development servers, you need to build the required packages:

```bash
# Option A: Build everything (recommended)
npm run build

# Option B: Build only what's needed
npm run build:core    # Shared accessibility analysis engine
npm run build:server  # Express API server
```

### Start Development Environment

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

This starts both:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173/ (React development server)
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3001/ (Express API server)

Expected output:
```
[0] Server listening on port 3001
[1] Frontend ready at http://localhost:5173/
```

## üìã Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev           # Frontend only (Vite)
npm run dev:server    # Backend only (Express)
npm run dev:full      # Both frontend and backend
npm run dev:cli       # CLI development mode

# Building
npm run build         # Build all packages + frontend

## üîê Browser Profile Sharing

Web Access Advisor supports **authenticated session testing** through browser profile sharing, allowing you to test logged-in workflows without re-authentication during analysis.

### How Profile Sharing Works

**Profile Detection:**
- Automatically detects available browser profiles (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Shows login status for each browser on your system
- Indicates which browsers have active sessions for tested domains

**Recording with Profiles:**
- Check "Use Profile" when recording authenticated workflows
- Browser launches with your existing login session (cookies, tokens, etc.)
- No need to log in again during recording - you're already authenticated

**Analysis Consistency:**
- Analysis phase uses the **same browser profile** as recording
- Maintains authentication state between recording and analysis
- Ensures analysis captures the same pages you recorded (not login screens)

### Supported Browsers

| Browser | Profile Support | Session Sharing | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Microsoft Edge** | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Reliable | Recommended for enterprise SSO |
| **Google Chrome** | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Enhanced | Improved profile detection |
| **Firefox** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | ‚ùå Not Yet | Profile detection only |

### Authentication Flow Options

**Option 1: Profile Sharing (Recommended for Auth)**
```
1. Already logged in to Chrome/Edge ‚Üí Check "Use Profile" 
2. Recording launches with existing session ‚Üí Record workflow
3. Analysis uses same profile ‚Üí Maintains login throughout
4. Results show authenticated pages ‚Üí Accurate analysis
```

**Option 2: Manual Login (Public Workflows)**
```
1. Don't check "Use Profile" ‚Üí Clean browser launches
2. Log in manually during recording ‚Üí Record workflow  
3. Analysis uses clean browser ‚Üí Hits login walls
4. Results may show login pages ‚Üí Less accurate for auth workflows
```

### Best Practices

**For Authenticated Workflows:**
- ‚úÖ **Always use profile sharing** for login-required sites
- ‚úÖ **Verify login status** shown in browser selection
- ‚úÖ **Close browser instances** before recording to avoid profile locks
- ‚úÖ **Use Chrome or Edge** for best profile compatibility

## StorageState export & replay validation

To make replays reuse authenticated sessions without requiring manual remote-debugging, Web Access Advisor now exports and validates Playwright storageState for recordings.

- When a recording stops we export the Playwright storage state (cookies + localStorage) to `./snapshots/<sessionId>/storageState.json`.
- The backend exposes two helper endpoints:
	- `GET /api/sessions/:id/storage-state/status` ‚Äî quick status (present/expired/earliest expiry) based on saved cookies.
	- `POST /api/sessions/:id/storage-state/validate` ‚Äî deep validation: the server loads the saved storageState into a temporary Playwright context, navigates to a probe URL and optionally waits for a selector to confirm the login is usable.
- Frontend flows:
	- Recording: sign in while recording if you want replays to reuse your login ‚Äî we save the login state at stop (storageState.json).
	- Replay: use the "Validate" button in the replay controls to check the saved state. If validation fails, the UI offers a lightweight "Re-login" detour that opens the browser for an interactive sign-in and saves a new storageState for the session.

Notes:
- We avoid logging cookie values or other secrets; validation is a behavioural probe (navigation + selector) rather than cookie inspection.
- Edge profile sharing remains the most reliable path for reusing local sign-in state on Windows; Chrome storageState is saved and validated but persistent-profile reuse may have platform-specific fallbacks.

**For Public Workflows:**  
- ‚úÖ **Clean browser is fine** for public sites
- ‚úÖ **Faster startup** without profile loading
- ‚úÖ **No authentication dependencies**

### Troubleshooting Profile Issues

**"Profile not accessible" errors:**
- Close all browser instances before recording
- Ensure browser isn't running in background
- Try different browser (Edge often more reliable than Chrome)

**Analysis shows login pages instead of recorded content:**
- Recording was likely done without profile sharing
- Re-record with "Use Profile" enabled
- Verify login status before starting analysis

**Chrome profile sharing not working:**
- Chrome can have stricter profile locking
- Try Microsoft Edge instead (same engine, better profile access)
- Ensure Chrome isn't running when starting recording

## üß† LLM Integration

The system uses Google Gemini for intelligent accessibility analysis:

- **Component Detection**: Automatically identifies interactive components (dropdowns, modals, tabs, etc.)
- **State Analysis**: Compares before/after DOM states during interactions
- **WCAG Compliance**: Provides expert-level accessibility assessments
- **Code Fixes**: Shows actual corrected HTML code examples
- **Screen Reader Focus**: Targets assistive technology compatibility

## üîß Environment Setup

### Automatic Setup
Playwright browsers are automatically installed during `npm install` via the `postinstall` script. This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Consistent browser versions across environments
- ‚úÖ Reliable CI/CD pipeline execution  
- ‚úÖ No manual browser installation steps

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Gemini AI (for accessibility analysis)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: Gemini HTML size limit (bytes, default 1MB)
GEMINI_HTML_MAX_SIZE=1048576

# Optional: OpenAI (for auto-playwright)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# App Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=Web Access Advisor
VITE_APP_VERSION=2.0.0
NODE_ENV=development
```

## üìñ Usage

1. **Build required packages** (see Quick Start above)
2. **Start development environment**: `npm run dev:full`
3. **Open frontend**: http://localhost:5173/
4. **Record interactions**: Enter URL and start recording
5. **Analyze accessibility**: Run replay with AI analysis enabled
