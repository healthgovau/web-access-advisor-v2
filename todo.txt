- llm issues still often have crappy non-conformant heading format (is this a different prompt?)
- llm seems to be logging issues under previous url
- chrome does not allow recording without signin - it seems to redirect back to signin page
- edge didn't show profile active - may have saved logins when I was logged in but Chrome did when I was not logged in
