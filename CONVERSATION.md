# Web Access Advisor - Development Conversations

## Session: June 16, 2025 - App Restoration & Project Cleanup

### Context
The main App.tsx file was missing/empty and needed restoration. The project also had compiled artifacts polluting source directories.

### Issues Found & Fixed

#### 1. **Missing App.tsx** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: `src/App.tsx` was empty, `main.tsx` was importing from non-existent `App.jsx`
- **Root Cause**: App.jsx was deleted but App.tsx was not properly created
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive App.tsx with:
  - React Router setup
  - TanStack Query integration  
  - All component imports with correct props
  - State management for recording/replay workflow
  - Error handling and loading states

#### 2. **Server Import Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Server was importing from `../packages/core/dist/index.js` 
- **Why This Was Wrong**: Should use TypeScript path aliases for better development experience
- **Solution**: Updated to use `@web-access-advisor/core` aliases
- **Benefit**: TypeScript handles compilation, better IDE support, cleaner imports

#### 3. **Compiled Artifacts in Source** ✅ FIXED  
- **Problem**: `.js`, `.d.ts`, `.d.ts.map` files in `packages/core/src/`
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript was compiling to source directory instead of dist only
- **Solution**: Removed all compiled artifacts from src directories
- **Files Cleaned**: `packages/core/src/*.js`, `packages/core/src/*.d.ts*`

#### 4. **Inconsistent TypeScript Configurations** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Different path mappings across packages
- **Solution**: Standardized all packages to use `@web-access-advisor/core/*` aliases
- **Updated**: `server/tsconfig.json`, `packages/cli/tsconfig.json`

### Architecture Decisions

#### **Import Strategy - Why We Changed from `dist/` to Package Aliases**
- **Before**: `import { X } from '../packages/core/dist/index.js'`
- **After**: `import { X } from '@web-access-advisor/core'`
- **Reasoning**: 
  - TypeScript project references handle compilation automatically
  - Better IDE support and go-to-definition
  - Cleaner, more maintainable imports
  - Follows modern monorepo best practices

#### **Component Props Matching**
- Discovered that components use different prop names than initially expected
- Had to match actual component implementations:
  - `URLInput`: expects `isLoading` not `disabled`
  - `RecordingControls`: expects `hasActions`, `isNavigated` 
  - `ActionList`: expects `isRecording` only (no edit/delete callbacks)
  - `ProgressIndicator`: expects `isVisible`, `title`, `message`
  - `AnalysisResults`: expects `analysisData` not `results`

### Files Modified
- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Created comprehensive main component
- ✅ `src/main.tsx` - Fixed import to use App.tsx
- ✅ `server/index.ts` - Fixed imports and TypeScript types  
- ✅ `server/tsconfig.json` - Updated path mappings
- ✅ `packages/cli/src/cli.ts` - Updated imports to use aliases
- ✅ `packages/cli/tsconfig.json` - Added path mappings
- ✅ `packages/core/src/` - Removed compiled artifacts

### What's `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`?
- **Purpose**: TypeScript incremental compilation cache
- **Contains**: File dependency graph, content hashes, build metadata
- **Benefits**: Faster rebuilds, only recompiles changed files
- **Status**: Normal and should be kept

### Current Project State
- ✅ Clean source directories (no compiled artifacts)
- ✅ Consistent TypeScript path mappings across packages  
- ✅ Working App.tsx with proper component integration
- ✅ Server with clean imports and no errors
- ✅ Proper monorepo structure with package aliases

### Next Steps Discussed
1. **Update TASK.md** - Mark completed work, add new discoveries
2. **Test the application** - Ensure everything builds and runs
3. **Continue with remaining features** - Recording, replay, analysis integration
