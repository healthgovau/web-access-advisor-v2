# Web Access Advisor - Project Planning

## Project Overview
**Web Access Advisor** is an AI-assisted accessibility assessment tool designed to help developers identify, understand, and fix accessibility issues in web applications. The tool combines automated testing with intelligent analysis to provide actionable insights for WCAG 2.1 compliance and screen reader compatibility.

## Target Users
- **Frontend Developers** - Primary users needing accessibility guidance during development
- **QA Engineers** - Secondary users performing accessibility testing workflows  
- **Accessibility Specialists** - Expert users requiring detailed compliance reports
- **Screen Reader Users** - End beneficiaries of improved accessibility implementations

## Accessibility Standards & Focus
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** - Primary standard for accessibility evaluation
- **Screen Reader Technology** - Special focus on NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver compatibility
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Complete keyboard accessibility validation
- **Color Contrast** - Automated contrast ratio checking and suggestions
- **Semantic HTML** - Proper heading structure, landmarks, and ARIA usage

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React** - Vanilla React 18+ for UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling framework
- **React Router** - Client-side routing for SPA navigation
- **React Hook Form** - Form handling and validation

### Browser Automation
- **Playwright** - Core browser automation engine
- **Auto-Playwright** - Enhanced automation capabilities
- **Axe-Core** - Accessibility testing engine integration
- **DOM Snapshots** - Before/after state capture for analysis

### AI & Analysis
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Direct API integration for accessibility insights
- **Custom Prompts** - Specialized accessibility evaluation prompts
- **Report Generation** - Structured accessibility reports with remediation guidance

### Configuration & Build
- **Vite** - Modern build tool and development server
- **Environment Variables** - Configuration through .env files
- **Node.js APIs** - Server-side functionality when needed

## Project Architecture

### Core Components
```
to be added as developnment proceeds
```

### Configuration & Build
```
public/                  # Static assets
├── index.html          # Main HTML template
└── favicon.ico         # Application icon

vite.config.js          # Vite build configuration
tailwind.config.js      # Tailwind CSS configuration
.env                    # Environment variables
package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Workflow Architecture

### 1. Assessment Initiation
- User inputs target URL via React frontend
- Configuration validation (API keys, browser settings)
- Assessment parameters setup (WCAG level, specific checks)

### 2. Browser Automation
- Playwright launches browser instance directly from React application
- DOM snapshot capture (initial state)
- User interaction simulation (keyboard navigation, screen reader paths)
- Post-interaction DOM snapshot capture

### 3. Accessibility Analysis
- Axe-core integration for automated rule checking
- Custom accessibility pattern detection
- WCAG 2.1 criterion mapping
- Screen reader compatibility validation

### 4. AI-Enhanced Evaluation
- Direct OpenAI API calls from React frontend
- Context-aware accessibility insights
- Remediation suggestions with code examples
- Priority scoring based on impact and effort

### 5. Report Generation
- Structured accessibility reports
- Before/after comparisons
- Actionable remediation guidance
- WCAG 2.1 compliance scoring

## Development Constraints

### File Size & Structure
- Maximum 500 lines per file
- Modular component architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent import patterns

### Testing Requirements
- Jest/React Testing Library for React components
- Playwright tests for E2E workflows
- Mock external services in unit tests
- Accessibility testing for the tool itself

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- **Performance**: Assessment completion < 60 seconds
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ alignment with manual accessibility audits
- **Coverage**: Complete WCAG 2.1 AA criterion coverage
- **Reliability**: 99%+ successful assessment completion rate

### User Experience Goals
- **Usability**: Non-accessibility experts can run assessments
- **Actionability**: Clear, implementable remediation guidance
- **Learning**: Educational value for developers learning accessibility
- **Integration**: Easy integration into existing development workflows

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Browser Compatibility**: Multi-browser Playwright configuration
- **API Rate Limits**: OpenAI API usage optimization and fallbacks
- **Large DOM Handling**: Efficient snapshot processing for complex sites
- **Configuration Complexity**: Simplified setup through environment variables

### Integration Risks
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Careful package version management
- **Environment Setup**: Automated setup through package.json scripts
- **Cross-platform Testing**: Ensure Playwright works across operating systems

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Batch URL Assessment** - Multiple page testing workflows
- **CI/CD Integration** - GitHub Actions, Jenkins integration hooks
- **Custom Rule Sets** - Organization-specific accessibility rules
- **Historical Tracking** - Accessibility improvement over time
- **Team Collaboration** - Shared reports and team workflows

### Potential Integrations
- **Design System Validation** - Component library accessibility checking
- **CMS Integration** - WordPress, Drupal accessibility plugins
- **Browser Extensions** - Real-time accessibility feedback
- **IDE Plugins** - VS Code, WebStorm accessibility linting
