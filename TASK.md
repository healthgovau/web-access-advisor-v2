### LLM Integration & Project Cleanup ✅ **COMPLETED: 2025-12-16**
- ✅ **GeminiService Implementation**: Created comprehensive `packages/core/src/gemini.ts` with structured accessibility analysis
- ✅ **Axe-Core Integration**: Full @axe-core/playwright integration with real accessibility testing
- ✅ **End-to-End Analysis Pipeline**: HTML → Axe Results → Gemini Analysis → Structured Report
- ✅ **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed duplicate @axe-core/playwright from root, kept only in core package
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Updated all TypeScript interfaces for axeResults and GeminiAnalysis
- ✅ **Complete Data Flow**: AccessibilityAnalyzer returns GeminiAnalysis in AnalysisResult

## 🔍 Discovered During Work

### 2025-06-16 - App Restoration & Cleanup
- **App.tsx was missing/empty**: Had to recreate entire main component
- **Component prop mismatches**: Discovered actual component APIs differ from expected
- **Compiled artifacts in source**: Found .js/.d.ts files polluting src directories  
- **Inconsistent import patterns**: Mixed dist/ imports and relative paths across packages
- **TypeScript project references**: Monorepo benefits from proper package aliases
- **TanStack Query integration**: Already configured and ready for use
- **React Router setup**: Single-page application with proper routing structure

### Component API Discoveries
- `URLInput`: expects `isLoading` prop, not `disabled`
- `RecordingControls`: expects `hasActions` and `isNavigated` props
- `ActionList`: simplified API with just `actions` and `isRecording`  
- `ProgressIndicator`: expects `isVisible`, `title`, `message` structure
- `AnalysisResults`: expects `analysisData` prop name, not `results`

### Architecture Insights
- Frontend should not directly import from core package
- Server acts as bridge between React UI and core engine
- CLI and server both consume core package directly
- Type definitions can be duplicated in frontend for independence

## 📝 Development Notes

### Current Focus
Starting with React frontend foundation to establish the user interface before integrating with existing Python backend modules.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Vite over Create React App**: Better performance and modern tooling
- **Context API for State**: Simpler than Redux for current scope
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent styling with accessibility utilities
- **Component-first approach**: Reusable UI elements before page layouts

### Integration Strategy
1. Build React frontend independently first
2. Create communication bridge to Python backend
3. Integrate with existing Playwright automation
4. Connect to LLM analysis modules
5. Implement report generation and display

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
# React and core dependencies
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @hookform/react-hook-form
npm install axios

# Playwright automation
npm install playwright
npm install auto-playwright
npm install @axe-core/playwright

# Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Development tools
npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install -D @playwright/test
npm install -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react
```

**Next Review**: Check progress on React foundation setup

### DOM Change Detection & Smart Snapshots
- ✅ **Intelligent Snapshot Capture**: Only snapshots when significant DOM changes occur
- ✅ **Change Type Classification**: Navigation, content, interaction, layout, none
- ✅ **Efficiency Optimization**: Skips unnecessary snapshots and analysis
- ✅ **Detailed Change Tracking**: Element counts, URL changes, title changes
- ✅ **Context-Aware Analysis**: LLM gets change type for better prompts

### DOM Change Types
- **Navigation**: URL changes, new pages (always snapshot)
- **Content**: Significant DOM updates, new data (snapshot if >10 elements)
- **Interaction**: Small DOM changes, UI state (snapshot if >2 elements)
- **Layout**: Style/CSS changes only (usually skip)
- **None**: No changes detected (skip snapshot)

### Component-Focused LLM Analysis (NEW!)
- ✅ **Before/After State Comparison**: Analyzes component behavior changes during interactions
- ✅ **Interactive Component Detection**: Automatically identifies dropdowns, modals, tabs, carousels, etc.
- ✅ **Code Fix Examples**: Provides actual corrected HTML code, not just descriptions
- ✅ **Component-Specific Reporting**: Detailed analysis per component type with WCAG rule references
- ✅ **Screen Reader Focus**: Specifically targets assistive technology compatibility issues

### Enhanced LLM Prompt Features
- **16 Component Types**: Expandable content, dropdowns, tabs, modals, autocomplete, error handling, dynamic content, keyboard nav, carousels, tree views, data tables, sortable tables, tooltips, context menus, validation messages, live regions
- **State Change Analysis**: Compares DOM before/after user interactions to detect attribute update failures
- **Practical Fixes**: Shows both problematic HTML and corrected code examples
- **Actionable Reports**: Component name, issue description, explanation, relevant HTML, corrected code, change summary
