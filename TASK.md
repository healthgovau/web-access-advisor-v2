## üìù Development Notes

### Current Focus
Starting with React frontend foundation to establish the user interface before integrating with existing Python backend modules.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Vite over Create React App**: Better performance and modern tooling
- **Context API for State**: Simpler than Redux for current scope
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent styling with accessibility utilities
- **Component-first approach**: Reusable UI elements before page layouts

### Integration Strategy
1. Build React frontend independently first
2. Create communication bridge to Python backend
3. Integrate with existing Playwright automation
4. Connect to LLM analysis modules
5. Implement report generation and display

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
# React and core dependencies
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @hookform/react-hook-form
npm install axios

# Playwright automation
npm install playwright
npm install auto-playwright
npm install @axe-core/playwright

# Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Development tools
