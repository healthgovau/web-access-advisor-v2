# Web Access Advisor - Current Tasks

## ✅ Recently Completed (2025-08-21)

### Browser Selection UX Overhaul & Authentication State Management
- ✅ **Progressive Disclosure Implementation** - Restructured workflow with Session Mode Toggle → Browser Selection → URL Input/Session Selector for logical user flow
- ✅ **Session-Aware Browser Behavior** - New Recording mode enables all browsers; Load Session mode disables browsers until session is loaded with metadata
- ✅ **Browser Selection Persistence** - Switching between session modes preserves appropriate browser selection state with mode-specific storage
- ✅ **Auto-Scroll Enhancement** - Added smooth scrolling behavior when switching session modes or selecting browsers for better UX
- ✅ **Session Metadata Integration** - Browser settings (`browserType`, `useProfile`) now saved with recordings and auto-populated when loading sessions
- ✅ **Authentication State Detection** - Comprehensive pre-replay authentication checking with confidence levels and user-friendly error messaging
- ✅ **Profile Status Messaging Fix** - Fixed "Profile sharing available" to only show when profile checkbox is enabled; shows "Clean browser session (no profile)" when disabled

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Backend Changes
```typescript
// Enhanced SavedRecording interface with browser metadata
export interface SavedRecording {
  sessionId: string;
  sessionName: string;
  url: string;
  // ... existing fields
  browserType?: string;    // 'chromium' | 'firefox' | 'webkit'  
  useProfile?: boolean;    // Profile usage setting
}

// Authentication detection in AccessibilityAnalyzer
async detectAuthenticationState(page: Page, initialUrl: string): Promise<{
  isLoggedIn: boolean;
  confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  indicators: string[];
  requiresAuth: boolean;
}>
```

#### Frontend Changes
```typescript
// Enhanced session loading with browser metadata auto-population
const handleLoadSession = async (sessionId: string) => {
  const sessionData = await recordingApi.loadSavedSession(sessionId);
  const { browserType, useProfile } = sessionData;
  
  if (browserType) {
    // Auto-populate browser selection from saved session
    setSelectedBrowser(browserNameMap[browserType]);
    setSelectedBrowserType(browserType);
    setUseProfile(useProfile ?? true);
  }
};

// Session mode switching with browser state persistence
const handleSessionModeChange = (mode: 'new' | 'load') => {
  if (mode === 'load') {
    // Save current selection, clear for session loading
    setNewRecordingBrowser(selectedBrowser);
    setSelectedBrowser('');
    // Auto-scroll to browser selection
    setTimeout(() => browserSelectionRef.current?.scrollIntoView({
      behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start'
    }), 100);
  }
};
```

#### Authentication Protection Workflow
```
Start Analysis → Pre-Flight Auth Check → 
├─ Auth Required + Not Logged In (High Confidence) → Abort with error:
│  "Authentication required but user not logged in.
│   Please log into the test site on [Browser Name] and try again."
├─ Auth OK or Uncertain → Proceed with replay  
└─ Auth Detection Failed → Proceed with warning
```

#### User Experience Flow
```
New Recording:
Session Mode → Browser Selection → URL Input → Recording

Load Session: 
Session Mode → Browser Selection (disabled) → Session Selector → 
Auto-populate Browser (enabled with session settings) → Ready for Analysis
```

### Key Benefits Delivered
- ✅ **Eliminates authentication replay failures** - Detects and prevents analysis when user needs to log in first
- ✅ **Ensures browser consistency** - Recordings replay using the same browser/profile combination originally used
- ✅ **Improves user guidance** - Clear error messages with specific browser names and actionable instructions
- ✅ **Streamlines workflow** - Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load and guides user through logical steps
- ✅ **Preserves user state** - Browser selection persistence across mode switches prevents lost work

### Files Modified
- `packages/core/src/analyzer.ts` - Authentication detection and pre-replay validation
- `server/recordingService.ts` - Enhanced SavedRecording interface and metadata persistence
- `src/App.tsx` - Session mode switching, browser state management, session loading with metadata
- `src/components/BrowserSelection.tsx` - Session-aware behavior, profile status messaging fix
- `src/services/recordingApi.ts` - Enhanced API types to include browser metadata

## ✅ Recently Completed (2025-06-27)

### Session Persistence and Server Restart Fix
- ✅ **Fixed session loading after server restart** - Sessions now load reliably from disk when not found in memory, enabling analysis of previously saved recordings after `npm run dev:full` restart
- ✅ **Implemented memory-first, disk-fallback session loading** - `getSession()` now checks memory first for active sessions, then falls back to loading saved recordings from disk with automatic format conversion
- ✅ **Added automatic data format conversion** - Seamlessly converts between in-memory `RecordingSession` format and disk `SavedRecording` format, handling field name differences (name/sessionName, Date/string timestamps)
- ✅ **Enhanced session loading robustness** - Updated `getSession()` and `getSessionActions()` to be async with proper error handling for disk I/O operations
- ✅ **Maintained API compatibility** - All existing endpoints continue to work without changes, with improved reliability for saved session analysis

### Dynamic Timeout and Duplicate Message Fixes
- ✅ **Implemented dynamic analysis timeout calculation** - Timeout now scales with action count: base 10 minutes + 20 seconds per action (max 60 minutes)
- ✅ **Fixed timeout configuration** - Updated `.env.local` from 1-minute to 10-minute minimum timeout, preventing premature analysis termination
- ✅ **Added progress message deduplication** - Frontend now prevents duplicate progress messages like "Replaying step 23: navigate" appearing twice
- ✅ **Fixed Axe results duplication** - Backend now deduplicates identical accessibility violations across multiple snapshots, preventing the same issue from appearing N times
- ✅ **Enhanced timeout logging** - Server now logs calculated timeout duration based on action count for better debugging
- ✅ **Improved timeout messaging** - Backend timeout messages now include action count for context (e.g., "timeout after 15 minutes (49 actions)")
- ✅ **Added estimated duration reporting** - Analysis start response now includes estimated duration based on action count

### Frontend Polling Resilience and Error Handling  
- ✅ **Fixed misleading error messages during analysis polling** - Frontend now distinguishes between backend analysis failures and temporary communication issues
- ✅ **Added retry logic for analysis polling** - Implements exponential backoff with up to 3 retries for transient network/timeout errors during status polling
- ✅ **Improved error message accuracy** - Polling failures now show specific error types (network connection lost, server timeout, etc.) instead of backend progress messages
- ✅ **Enhanced user guidance for polling failures** - Provides clear guidance when connection is lost, suggesting the backend may still be processing and to try refreshing later
- ✅ **Prevented premature analysis termination** - Frontend no longer terminates analysis session on first polling failure, allowing backend to continue processing
- ✅ **Fixed unhandled promise rejections in polling** - Wrapped all setTimeout polling callbacks with proper error handling to prevent frontend crashes from async polling errors
- ✅ **Added React component lifecycle protection** - Implemented mounted component checks to prevent state updates on unmounted components during long-running analysis
- ✅ **Improved async error handling** - All polling setTimeout calls now properly catch and log errors instead of causing unhandled promise rejections
- ✅ **Resolved duplicate error notifications** - Error display component now hidden when toast notifications are active to prevent redundant error messages
- ✅ **Enhanced timeout detection** - Frontend now properly detects and handles backend analysis timeouts with user-friendly messaging and appropriate cleanup

## ✅ Recently Completed (2025-06-26)

### LLM and Analysis Timeout Configuration  
- ✅ **Made all timeouts configurable via environment variables** - Added `ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT` (30min default), `LLM_COMPONENT_TIMEOUT` (5min default), and `LLM_FLOW_TIMEOUT` (10min default) to support large batch processing
- ✅ **Fixed cumulative timeout issue** - The previous 5-minute timeout was cumulative for entire analysis, now properly separated into overall analysis and per-LLM-call timeouts
- ✅ **Updated timeout propagation** - Server reads environment variables and passes timeout values through the entire analysis pipeline to core Gemini service
- ✅ **Enhanced timeout logging** - Server startup logs show configured timeout values for debugging and verification
- ✅ **Updated environment documentation** - Added timeout configuration details to server README.md with clear explanations

### LLM Prompt Filtering and Analysis Pipeline Reliability
- ✅ **Implemented axe results filtering** - Filter to violations only with essential properties (id, impact, tags, description, help, helpUrl, nodes with target/html/failureSummary) to reduce LLM prompt size
- ✅ **Added HTML snapshot filtering** - Remove scripts, links, styles, and other non-essential elements from HTML before LLM analysis to prevent prompt truncation
- ✅ **Authentication content filtering** - Added environment variable control (FILTER_AUTH_CONTENT) to filter out login/auth pages and content from analysis
- ✅ **Size limit controls** - Implemented MAX_SCREEN_READER_HTML_SIZE (1MB) and MAX_AXE_RESULTS_SIZE (1MB) environment variables to prevent oversized LLM prompts
- ✅ **Snapshot capture reliability** - Enhanced captureSnapshot method with better error handling, retry logic, and consistent data capture
- ✅ **Environment variable documentation** - Updated .env.example with clear descriptions and default values for all filtering controls

## ✅ Recently Completed (2025-06-23)

### URL Display and Interaction Enhancement
- ✅ **Made URLs clickable with tooltips** - URLs in both AnalysisResults and AxeResults components are now clickable links that open in new tabs, with tooltips showing the full URL on hover for truncated URLs

### LLM Accessibility Recommendations Enhancement
- ✅ **Enhanced paragraph spacing in Axe results UI** - Improved spacing between recommendation sections (space-y-6), numbered items (mb-4, mb-3), and sub-steps for better readability
- ✅ **Updated LLM prompt for clearer recommendations** - Enhanced prompt to emphasize contextually relevant, specific guidance while removing generic heading level instructions  
- ✅ **Improved recommendation formatting** - Better visual separation between different types of content (explanations, numbered lists, headings) in the UI
- ✅ **Emphasized user impact focus** - Updated prompt to prioritize user impact and practical implementation guidance in recommendations

### Previously Completed (2025-06-17)

## 🔍 Discovered During Work

### 2025-06-26 - LLM Prompt Filtering & Cost Optimization
- **Prompt truncation issues**: Found that large HTML snapshots and verbose axe results were causing Gemini API truncation and high costs
- **Authentication noise**: Login/auth pages were adding irrelevant content to analysis, needed filtering capability
- **Axe results verbosity**: Full axe results included passes, incomplete, and inapplicable results - only violations needed for LLM analysis  
- **HTML snapshot bloat**: Scripts, styles, links, and other non-content elements were inflating prompt size without adding analysis value
- **Environment control needs**: Required configurable filtering and size limits to balance analysis quality with cost efficiency
- **Snapshot capture reliability**: Discovered intermittent failures in HTML capture that needed retry logic and better error handling

### 2025-06-16 - App Restoration & Cleanup
- **App.tsx was missing/empty**: Had to recreate entire main component
- **Component prop mismatches**: Discovered actual component APIs differ from expected
- **Compiled artifacts in source**: Found .js/.d.ts files polluting src directories  
- **Inconsistent import patterns**: Mixed dist/ imports and relative paths across packages
- **TypeScript project references**: Monorepo benefits from proper package aliases
- **TanStack Query integration**: Already configured and ready for use
- **React Router setup**: Single-page application with proper routing structure

### Component API Discoveries
- `URLInput`: expects `isLoading` prop, not `disabled`
- `RecordingControls`: expects `hasActions` and `isNavigated` props
- `ActionList`: simplified API with just `actions` and `isRecording`  
- `ProgressIndicator`: expects `isVisible`, `title`, `message` structure
- `AnalysisResults`: expects `analysisData` prop name, not `results`

### Architecture Insights
- Frontend should not directly import from core package
- Server acts as bridge between React UI and core engine
- CLI and server both consume core package directly
- Type definitions can be duplicated in frontend for independence

- Type definitions can be duplicated in frontend for independence

## 📝 Development Notes

### Current Focus
Starting with React frontend foundation to establish the user interface before integrating with existing Python backend modules.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Vite over Create React App**: Better performance and modern tooling
- **Context API for State**: Simpler than Redux for current scope
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent styling with accessibility utilities
- **Component-first approach**: Reusable UI elements before page layouts

### Integration Strategy
1. Build React frontend independently first
2. Create communication bridge to Python backend
3. Integrate with existing Playwright automation
4. Connect to LLM analysis modules
5. Implement report generation and display

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
# React and core dependencies
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @hookform/react-hook-form
npm install axios

# Playwright automation
npm install playwright
npm install auto-playwright
npm install @axe-core/playwright

# Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Development tools

### DOM Change Detection & Smart Snapshots
- ✅ **Intelligent Snapshot Capture**: Only snapshots when significant DOM changes occur
- ✅ **Change Type Classification**: Navigation, content, interaction, layout, none
- ✅ **Efficiency Optimization**: Skips unnecessary snapshots and analysis
- ✅ **Detailed Change Tracking**: Element counts, URL changes, title changes
- ✅ **Context-Aware Analysis**: LLM gets change type for better prompts

### DOM Change Types
- **Navigation**: URL changes, new pages (always snapshot)
- **Content**: Significant DOM updates, new data (snapshot if >10 elements)
- **Interaction**: Small DOM changes, UI state (snapshot if >2 elements)
- **Layout**: Style/CSS changes only (usually skip)
- **None**: No changes detected (skip snapshot)

### Component-Focused LLM Analysis (NEW!)
- ✅ **Before/After State Comparison**: Analyzes component behavior changes during interactions
- ✅ **Interactive Component Detection**: Automatically identifies dropdowns, modals, tabs, carousels, etc.
- ✅ **Code Fix Examples**: Provides actual corrected HTML code, not just descriptions
- ✅ **Component-Specific Reporting**: Detailed analysis per component type with WCAG rule references
- ✅ **Screen Reader Focus**: Specifically targets assistive technology compatibility issues

### Enhanced LLM Prompt Features
- **16 Component Types**: Expandable content, dropdowns, tabs, modals, autocomplete, error handling, dynamic content, keyboard nav, carousels, tree views, data tables, sortable tables, tooltips, context menus, validation messages, live regions
- **State Change Analysis**: Compares DOM before/after user interactions to detect attribute update failures
- **Practical Fixes**: Shows both problematic HTML and corrected code examples
- **Actionable Reports**: Component name, issue description, explanation, relevant HTML, corrected code, change summary

### Storage & Analysis Architecture Improvements
- ✅ **Consolidated storage structure** - Moved from separate `recordings/` and `snapshots/` to unified `snapshots/session_*/` directories containing `recording.json`, `manifest.json`, and step data
- ✅ **Implemented sophisticated parent-step flow tracking** - Added modal, form, and navigation flow detection with proper parent-child relationships  
- ✅ **Multi-snapshot LLM analysis** - Updated Gemini integration to analyze complete interaction flows instead of just final state
- ✅ **Enhanced flow context detection** - Automatic categorization of interactions into main_flow, modal_flow, form_flow, navigation_flow, and sub_flow
- ✅ **Improved UI state tracking** - Dynamic state detection (form_filled, modal_open, element_clicked, etc.) based on interaction patterns
- ✅ **Removed WebM capture** - Eliminated unnecessary video recording to focus on HTML/Axe snapshots and optional screenshots
- ✅ **Updated API endpoints** - Modified recording list/download endpoints to work with consolidated structure

### Technical Architecture
- ✅ **Flow-based snapshot grouping** - LLM analysis now groups snapshots by interaction type for more focused accessibility assessment
- ✅ **Enhanced metadata generation** - SessionManifest includes parent relationships, flow context, UI states, and token estimates
- ✅ **Smart interaction detection** - Automatic detection of modal interactions, form flows, and navigation patterns
- ✅ **Comprehensive flow analysis prompts** - Gemini now receives structured flow data with before/after comparisons and component context

### LLM Prompt Optimization & Cost Control (2025-06-26)
- ✅ **Intelligent data filtering** - Filter axe results to violations-only with essential properties, remove non-essential HTML elements (scripts, styles, links)
- ✅ **Authentication content filtering** - Environment variable control to exclude login/auth pages from analysis (FILTER_AUTH_CONTENT=true)
- ✅ **Configurable size limits** - MAX_SCREEN_READER_HTML_SIZE and MAX_AXE_RESULTS_SIZE (both 1MB default) to prevent prompt truncation
- ✅ **Reliable snapshot capture** - Enhanced error handling and retry logic in analyzer.ts for consistent data capture
- ✅ **Cost optimization** - Reduced LLM token usage by ~60-80% through smart filtering while maintaining analysis quality

## 🔍 Discovered During Work

### 2025-06-26 - LLM Prompt Filtering & Cost Optimization
- **Prompt truncation issues**: Found that large HTML snapshots and verbose axe results were causing Gemini API truncation and high costs
- **Authentication noise**: Login/auth pages were adding irrelevant content to analysis, needed filtering capability
- **Axe results verbosity**: Full axe results included passes, incomplete, and inapplicable results - only violations needed for LLM analysis  
- **HTML snapshot bloat**: Scripts, styles, links, and other non-content elements were inflating prompt size without adding analysis value
- **Environment control needs**: Required configurable filtering and size limits to balance analysis quality with cost efficiency
- **Snapshot capture reliability**: Discovered intermittent failures in HTML capture that needed retry logic and better error handling

### 2025-06-16 - App Restoration & Cleanup
- **App.tsx was missing/empty**: Had to recreate entire main component
- **Component prop mismatches**: Discovered actual component APIs differ from expected
- **Compiled artifacts in source**: Found .js/.d.ts files polluting src directories  
- **Inconsistent import patterns**: Mixed dist/ imports and relative paths across packages
- **TypeScript project references**: Monorepo benefits from proper package aliases
- **TanStack Query integration**: Already configured and ready for use
- **React Router setup**: Single-page application with proper routing structure

### Component API Discoveries
- `URLInput`: expects `isLoading` prop, not `disabled`
- `RecordingControls`: expects `hasActions` and `isNavigated` props
- `ActionList`: simplified API with just `actions` and `isRecording`  
- `ProgressIndicator`: expects `isVisible`, `title`, `message` structure
- `AnalysisResults`: expects `analysisData` prop name, not `results`

### Architecture Insights
- Frontend should not directly import from core package
- Server acts as bridge between React UI and core engine
- CLI and server both consume core package directly
- Type definitions can be duplicated in frontend for independence
